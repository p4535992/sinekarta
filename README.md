for the legally-recognized electronic document storage. 
By using SineKarta end users will get rid of the paper documents, having granted that the digital copies will be 
considered authentic by the government institutions. 
Although the default settings have been choosen to be compatible with the 2008's Italian financial law, 
the highly customizable SineKarta core will be able to adapt his behaviour to the various national contexts.

Another SineKarta key aspect is the easy support for the digital signature and timestamp. 
End users will be able to digitally sign their documents by using a local keystore, a signature webservice or

The signing process will take place directly inside the browser, without the need to download the document, 
sign it and upload it again to Alfresco.
